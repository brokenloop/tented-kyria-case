# 3d Printable Kyria Tented Case 

This is a tented case for the [kyria](https://blog.splitkb.com/blog/introducing-the-kyria) keyboard, based on the opensource [3d printed case](https://github.com/splitkb/kyria/tree/master/3D%20Printed%20Case) on the official repository.

## Usage

This model was made using openscad, so you'll need that if you want to make any changes to the model itself. Otherwise, just load up the stl files in your favourite slicing software and get printing.
